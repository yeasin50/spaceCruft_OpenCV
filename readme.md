 countors => makes laggy,           
 mobiletSSD => works but on hand it's hard to detect     
 color detector => on progress      
 or train CNN    
- detect phone   
    - detect on Light
    - detect off light
- detect no phone X

about color detection. i just can use light on and off option here. maybe its better because all my test gonna at midNight and the env isnot that bright , so I may reduce the desire for now being working multiple things.
Here is how it gonna work
 - detect if flash light is on/off
 - if on shoot bullets . that's all
 -  then enemy maker and mover engine
 - player bullets engine 
 - collisions 
 - score and health
